DEBUGGING

If you need to debug the application, make sure
that the working-directory for the debug-session
is set to <WHID-src-dir>/src/client. Then start the
program, with the --devel command-line argument.
This forces whid to use resource-directories
relative to the workin-directory above.

This works with MSVC 6 as well as kdevelop.
